# Galaban's Repop Message Plugin

This plugin will pay attention to the Legend of the Jedi mud and send a "-->Repop<--" message when the world repopulates.  Since LOTJ repopulates the area within 30-60 seconds after the area spawn message, this repop message is approximate, and occurs at 45 seconds post-spawn message.

## To install
1. Download the raw files from github:
https://raw.github.com/galaban/LOTJRepopMessage/master/Galaban_RepopMessage.xml
https://raw.github.com/galaban/LOTJRepopMessage/master/LotJMSDPPlanet.lua
2. Place the raw file into your "plugins" directory.  This is fund in your Mushclient folder under /worlds/plugins.
3. Install the plugain in MushClient.  From the "File" menu, choose "plugins", then "Add".  Select the xml file and choose "OK".

Note: This requires LotJMSDPPlanet.lua as well
